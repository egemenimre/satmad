# Tutorials

Here there is a number of small tutorials to get you going with SatMAD. You can find the interactive Jupyter notebook versions of these at the [project repository](https://github.com/egemenimre/satmad/tree/master/docs/tutorials).

In addition to the tutorials in this section, there is a repository of how-to guides and analyses in a dedicated project called SatMAD Applications, [available at Github as Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/egemenimre/satmad_applications) and [in plain document format](https://satmad-applications.readthedocs.io/).
