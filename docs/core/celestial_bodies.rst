Celestial Bodies
==================
Celestial bodies in SatMAD are defined with the :class:`.CelestialBody` class. A celestial body
stores its relevant values for various calculations such as force models within orbit
propagation. As such, each `CelestialBody` object is a central repository of information for that
body.

There are default celestial bodies such as `EARTH`, `MOON` and `SUN` for convenience.
